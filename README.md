# Electronics Store UI  

This is a simple Flutter project that implements the UI for an electronics store.  
The app consists of two main pages:  
1. **Home Page**: Displays a list of all electronic devices (e.g., headphones, laptops, phones, cameras, etc.).  
2. **Product Details Page**: Shows detailed information about a selected device.  

## Purpose  
This project was created as part of a learning process. I followed a tutorial to practice building user interfaces using Flutter.  

## Notes  
This is a beginner-level project focused on understanding the basics of Flutter UI development.
